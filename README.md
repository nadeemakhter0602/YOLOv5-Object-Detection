# Object Detection with YOLOv5

Simple program to run [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) object detection models trained on [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home) on images. [OpenCV's dnn module](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d2/d58/tutorial_table_of_content_dnn.html) and [ONNXRuntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) is used for inference.
